pritamApplication is a frontend web application developed by me to demonstrate a clean, modern, and user-friendly login interface using core web technologies. This project is built with HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for styling and responsive layout, and JavaScript for basic interactivity, making it suitable for beginners as well as for use as a base in larger applications. The application focuses on simplicity and usability, presenting users with a clear entry point through a login/get-started interface that can be easily extended with real authentication logic such as Firebase or backend APIs. It is hosted using GitHub Pages, ensuring easy access and deployment without additional setup. The project is well-structured, easy to understand, and designed to help improve practical frontend development skills, UI design understanding, and real-world project presentation for portfolios and academic submissions.
